  probably not in use anywhere.

Bugfixes (win32):

  version. [Bug 669625]

Bugfixes (win32):

- don't recreate overlapped structures and events on each
  read/write.
- don't set unneeded event masks.
- dont use DOS device names for ports > 9.
- remove send timeout (its not used in the linux impl. anyway).


Version 1.21    30 Sep 2003
---------------------------
Bugfixes (win32):

- name for COM10 was not built correctly, found by Norm Davis.

Bugfixes (examples):

- small change in ``miniterm.py`` that should mage it run on cygwin,
  [Bug 809904] submitted by Rolf Campbell.


Version 2.0b1    1 Oct 2003
---------------------------
Transition to the Python 2.0 series:

- New implementation only supports Python 2.2+, backwards compatibility
  should be maintained almost everywhere.
  The OS handles (like the ``hComPort`` or ``fd`` attribute) were prefixed
  with an underscore. The different names stay, as anyone that uses one of
  these has to write platform specific code anyway.
- Common base class ``serialutil.SerialBase`` for all implementations.
- ``PARITY_NONE``, ``PARITY_EVEN``, ``PARITY_ODD`` constants changed and all
  these constants moved to ``serialutil.py`` (still available as
  ``serial.PARITY_NONE`` etc. and they should be used that way)
- Added ``serial.PARITY_NAMES`` (implemented in ``serialutil.PARITY_NAMES``).
  This dictionary can be used to convert parity constants to meaningful
  strings.
- Each Serial class and instance has a list of supported values:
  ``BAUDRATES``, ``BYTESIZES``, ``PARITIES``, ``STOPBITS``Ggg
  (i.e. ``serial.Serial.BAUDRATES or s = serial.Serial; s.BAUDRATES``)
  these values can be used to fill in value sin GUI dialogs etc.
- Creating a ``Serial()`` object without port spec returns an unconfigured,
  closed port. Useful if a GUI dialog should take a port and configure
  it.
- New methods for ``serial.Serial`` instances: ``open()``, ``isOpen()``
- A port can be opened and closed as many times as desired.
- Instances of ``serial.Serial`` have ``baudrate``, ``bytesize``, ``timeout``
  etc. attributes implemented as properties, all can be set while the port is
  opened. It will then be reconfigured.
- Improved ``__doc__``'s.
- New ``test_advanced.py`` for the property setting/getting testing.
- Small bugfix on posix with get* methods (return value should be true a
  boolean).
- added a ``__repr__`` that returns a meaningful string will all the serial
  setting, easy for debugging.
- The serialposix module does not throw an exception on unsupported
  platforms, the message is still printed. The idea that it may still
  work even if the platform itself s not known, it simply tries to do
  the posix stuff anyway (It's likely that opening ports by number
  fails, but by name it should work).


Version 2.0b2    4 Oct 2003
---------------------------
- Added serial port configuration dialog for wxPython to the examples.
- Added terminal application for wxPython with wxGlade design file
  to the examples.
- Jython support is currently broken as Jython does not have a Python 2.2
  compatible release out yet


Version 2.0      6 Nov 2003
---------------------------
- Fixes ``setup.py`` for older distutils


Version 2.1     28 Jul 2004

Bugfixes (posix):

- ``fd == 0`` fix from Vsevolod Lobko
- netbsd fixes from Erik Lindgren
- Dynamicaly lookup baudrates and some cleanups

Bugfixes (examples):

- CRLF handling of ``miniterm.py`` should be more consistent on Win32
  and others. Added LF only command line option
- Multithreading fixes to ``wxTerminal.py`` (helps with wxGTK)
- Small change for wxPython 2.5 in ``wxSerialConfigDialog.py`` [Bug 994856]

New Features:

- Implement write timeouts (``writeTimeout`` parameter)


Version 2.2     31 Jul 2005
---------------------------
Bugfixes:

- [Bug 1014227]: property <del> broken
- [Bug 1105687]: ``serial_tcp_example.py``: ``--localport`` option

  from the ``rtscts`` setting. (Currenly Win32 only, ignored on other
  platforms)


Version 2.3     19 Jun 2008
---------------------------
New Features:

- iterator interface. ``for line in Serial(...): ...`` is now possible
  Suggested by Bernhard Bender
- ``sendBreak()`` accepts a ``duration`` argument. Default duration increased.
- win32 handles \\.\COMx format automatically for com ports of higher number
  (COM10 is internally translated to \\.\COM10 etc.)

- update VERSION variable
- update wxSerialConfigDialog.py and wxTerminal.py compatibility with
  wxPython 2.8 (Peleg)

Bugfixes (jython):

 - The Jython backend tries javax.comm and gnu.io (Seo Sanghyeon)


Version 2.5-rc1  2009-07-30
---------------------------
New Features:

- Python 3.x support (through 2to3)
- compatible with Python io library (Python 2.6+)
- Support for Win32 is now written on the top of ctypes (bundled with
  Python 2.5+) instead of pywin32 (patch by Giovanni Bajo).
- 1.5 stop bits (STOPBITS_ONE_POINT_FIVE, implemented on all platforms)
- miniterm application extended (CTRL+T -> menu)
- miniterm.py is now installed as "script"
- add scanlinux.py example
- add port_publisher example

- add ``getSettingsDict`` and ``applySettingsDict`` serial object methods

  provides better error handling [removed again in later releases].

Bugfixes:

- Improve and fix tcp_serial_redirector example.
- [Bug 2603052] 5-bit mode (needs 1.5 stop bits in some cases)

Bugfixes (posix):

- [Bug 2810169] Propagate exceptions raised in serialposix _reconfigure
- [Bug 2562610] setting non standard baud rates on Darwin (Emmanuel Blot)

Version 2.5-rc2  2010-01-02
---------------------------
New Features:

- Documentation update, now written with Sphinx/ReST
- Updated miniterm.py example
- experimental RFC-2217 client support (serial.rfc2217.Serial, see docs)
- add ``loop://`` device for testing.
- add ``serial.serial_for_url`` factory function (support for native ports and
  ``rfc2217``, ``socket`` and ``loop`` URLs)
- add new example: ``rfc2217_server.py``
- tests live in their own directory now (no longer in examples)

Bugfixes:

- [Bug 2915810] Fix for suboption parsing in rfc2217
- Packaging bug (missed some files)

Bugfixes (posix):

- improve write timeout behavior
- [Bug 2836297] move Linux specific constants to not break other platforms
- ``poll`` based implementation for ``read`` is in a separate class
  ``PosixPollSerial``, as it is not supported well on all platforms (the
  default ``Serial`` class uses select).
- changed error handling in ``read`` so that disconnected devices are
  detected.


Bugfixes (win32):

- [Bug 2886763] hComPort doesn't get initialized for Serial(port=None)


Version 2.5      2010-07-22
---------------------------
New Features:

- [Bug 2976262] dsrdtr should default to False
  ``dsrdtr`` parameter default value changed from ``None`` (follow ``rtscts``
  setting) to ``False``. This means ``rtscts=True`` enables hardware flow
  control on RTS/CTS but no longer also on DTR/DSR. This change mostly
  affects Win32 as on other platforms, that setting was ignored anyway.
- Improved xreadlines, it is now a generator function that yields lines as they
  are received (previously it called readlines which would only return all
  lines read after a read-timeout). However xreadlines is deprecated an not
  available when the io module is used. Use ``for line in Serial(...):``
  instead.

Bugfixes:

- [Bug 2925854] test.py produces exception with python 3.1
- [Bug 3029812] 2.5rc2 readline(s) doesn't work

Bugfixes (posix):

- [BUG 3006606] Nonblocking error - Unix platform

Bugfixes (win32):

- [Bug 2998169] Memory corruption at faster transmission speeds.
  (bug introduced in 2.5-rc1)


Version 2.6      2011-11-02
---------------------------
New Features:

- Moved some of the examples to serial.tools so that they can be used
  with ``python -m``
- serial port enumeration now included as ``serial.tools.list_ports``
- URL handers for ``serial_for_url`` are now imported dynamically. This allows
  to add protocols w/o editing files. The list
  ``serial.protocol_handler_packages`` can be used to add or remove user
  packages with protocol handlers (see docs for details).
- new URL type: hwgrep://<regexp> uses list_ports module to search for ports
  by their description
- serveral internal changes to improve Python 3.x compatibility (setup.py,
  use of absolute imports and more)

Bugfixes:

- [Bug 3093882] calling open() on an already open port now raises an exception
- [Bug 3245627] connection-lost let rfc2217 hangs in closed loop

  set the initial state on port open.
