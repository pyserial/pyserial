  version. [Bug 669625]

- remove send timeout (its not used in the linux impl. anyway).


Version 1.21    30 sep 2003
---------------------------
Bugfixes (win32):

- name for COM10 was not built correctly, found by Norm Davis.

Bugfixes (examples):

- small change in ``miniterm.py`` that should mage it run on cygwin,
  [Bug 809904] submitted by Rolf Campbell.

Version 2.0b1    1 Oct 2003
---------------------------
Transition to the Python 2.0 series:

- New implementation only supports Python 2.2+, backwards compatibility
  should be maintained almost everywhere.
  The OS handles (like the ``hComPort`` or ``fd`` attribute) were prefixed
  with an underscore. The different names stay, as anyone that uses one of
  these has to write platform specific code anyway.
- Common base class ``serialutil.SerialBase`` for all implementations.
- ``PARITY_NONE``, ``PARITY_EVEN``, ``PARITY_ODD`` constants changed and all
  these constants moved to ``serialutil.py`` (still available as
  ``serial.PARITY_NONE`` etc. and they should be used that way)
- Added ``serial.PARITY_NAMES`` (implemented in ``serialutil.PARITY_NAMES``).
  This dictionary can be used to convert parity constants to meaningful
  strings.
- Each Serial class and instance has a list of supported values:
  ``BAUDRATES``, ``BYTESIZES``, ``PARITIES``, ``STOPBITS``
  (i.e. ``serial.Serial.BAUDRATES or s = serial.Serial; s.BAUDRATES``)
  these values can be used to fill in value sin GUI dialogs etc.
- Creating a ``Serial()`` object without port spec returns an unconfigured,
  closed port. Useful if a GUI dialog should take a port and configure
  it.
- New methods for ``serial.Serial`` instances: ``open()``, ``isOpen()``
- A port can be opened and closed as many times as desired.
- Instances of ``serial.Serial`` have ``baudrate``, ``bytesize``, ``timeout``
  etc. attributes implemented as properties, all can be set while the port is
  opened. It will then be reconfigured.
- Improved ``__doc__``'s.
- New ``test_advanced.py`` for the property setting/getting testing.
- Small bugfix on posix with get* methods (return value should be true a
  boolean).
- added a ``__repr__`` that returns a meaningful string will all the serial
  setting, easy for debugging.
- The serialposix module does not throw an exception on unsupported
  platforms, the message is still printed. The idea that it may still
  work even if the platform itself s not known, it simply tries to do
  the posix stuff anyway (It's likely that opening ports by number
  fails, but by name it should work).


Version 2.0b2    4 Oct 2003
---------------------------
- Added serial port configuration dialog for wxPython to the examples.
- Added terminal application for wxPython with wxGlade design file
  to the examples.
- Jython support is currenty broken as Jython does not have a Python 2.2
  compatible release out yet


Version 2.0      6 Nov 2003
---------------------------
- Fixes ``setup.py`` for older distutils

- netbsd fixes from Erik Lindgren
- Dynamicaly lookup baudrates and some cleanups

Bugfixes (examples):

- CRLF handling of ``miniterm.py`` should be more consistent on Win32
  and others. Added LF only command line option
- Multithreading fixes to ``wxTerminal.py`` (helps with wxGTK)
- Small change for wxPython 2.5 in ``wxSerialConfigDialog.py`` [Bug 994856]

New Features:

- Implement write timeouts (``writeTimeout`` parameter)


Version 2.2     31 Jul 2005
---------------------------
Bugfixes:

- [Bug 1014227]: property <del> broken

  from the ``rtscts`` setting. (Currenly Win32 only, ignored on other
  platforms)


Version 2.3     xxx
---------------------------
New Features:

- iterator interface. ``for line in Serial(...): ...`` is now possible
  Sugested by Bernhard Bender
